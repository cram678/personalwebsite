    <h1>HI IM MARC ROSENBERG</h1>
    <p>I am a 17 year old aspiring Computer Scientist as well as conservationist. I became intrested in Computer Science from a young age due to a fascination with electronic devices like video game consoles tablets or computers. In middle school after taking an introductory computer science course I became intrigued by the problem solving aspect of Computer Science and began to learn more about it. I also became a conservationalist due to my fascination with nature and love for outdoor activities such as sports or other outdoor recreational activities.</p>

    <h2>Working with the New York Botanical Gardens</h2>
    <p>As a child every year I visited the New York Botanical Garden's annual train show. Every year without fail I was enraptured by the amazing train display as well as the buildings made entirely of plants. During my softmore year of highschool I had the opportunity to volunteer at the New York Botanical Garden and I siezed the oppurtunity. I have so far volunteered almost 200 hours of my time working in the Everett Childrens Adventure Garden as an Explainer helping children experience nature.

    <h2>Working as a Fishers Island Sentinel</h2>
    <p>Every summer for as long as I can remember I've gone to my grandma's house in a place called Fishers Island for the summer. After a while I came to appreciate the wildlife on the island as something that cant be seen everywhere. To help protect the island's wildlife I joined the Fishers Island Conservancy</p>
    <h3>Protecting the Sea Grass</h3>
    <p>A large part of the aquatic ecosystem in the long island sound is the Sea Grass which provides habitats and helps filter the water, but for a long time now the amount of Sea Grass in the long Island sound has been rapidly decreasing due to bad boating practices and pollution I helped raise awarness of the disappearing Sea Grass by creating an educational video and helped the Sea Grass management coalition with water tests.</p>
